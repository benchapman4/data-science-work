*Purpose*: To create an effective visualization, we need to keep our *purpose* firmly in mind. There are many different ways to visualize data, and the only way we can judge efficacy is with respect to our purpose.

In this challenge you'll visualize the same data in two different ways, aimed at two different purposes.


```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

```


```{r load}
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "winemag-data-130k-v2.csv"

## Load the data
df_wine <- read_csv(filename)
```
```{r load}
df_wine %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = price, y = points))
```

```{r load}

df_wine %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes( x = points, binwidth = 5, edge =90))
```

```{r load}

summary(df_wine)
glimpse(df_wine)
```
```{r load}
